Standard daily prices data 2010-2015 including the following: Open, close, low, high; returns (with and without dividens) and excess returns; trading volume, market cap, shares outstanding; and other supplementary information. Covers all equities in NYSE, NASDAQ, and Arca along with composite indices, equal and value-weighted exchange returns.

_If the closing price is not available for any given period, the number in the price field is replaced with a bid/ask average. Bid/ask averages have dashes placed in front of them. These do not incorrectly reflect negative prices; they serve to distinguish bid/ask averages from actual closing prices. If neither the price nor bid/ask average is available, the field is set to zero._
